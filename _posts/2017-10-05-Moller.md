# Future-proofing software delivery using Kubernetes on ACS

Harald A. Møller AS (part of the Møller Group) is Norway's largest car importer and has imported Volkswagen AG's car brands since 1948.

They reached out to Microsoft for building a container-based architecture, specifically on Kubernetes, in Azure. Some of the technologies they use on a daily basis are: 
Scala, Node, Ruby, Java. They intended to connect their ACS cluster with on-prem infrastructure through ExpressRoute, and set up a CI/CD pipeline through Jenkins.

This document describes the process. 

## Technologies Used
- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), container orchestration
- [Azure Container Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-service/), host environment for Kubernetes
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), container technology
- [Azure Active Directory](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/active-directory/), identity management
- [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/), build/deployment engine
- [Nexus](https://www.sonatype.com/nexus-repository-oss), container repository
- [Azure Command line tools](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest), remote controlling azure
- [HipChat](https://www.stride.com/), chat/collaboration tool

## Goals for the hackfest
In general, Møllergruppens goal is to aquire the know-how to architecting container-based solutions in all new development. We set up a plan to learn as much as possible about: 

- Setting up an ARM Template for deploying Kubernetes on ACS in a new resource group
  - How to create an ACS-E Template, and modify it to suit our needs
  - Use the ACS-E Template to create an ARM template for infrastructure generation in Azure
- Set up automated deployment in a CI/CD Pipeline through Jenkins
- Set up role-based access to Kubernetes
- Learn more about the Azure CLI

## Hackfest participants

Møllergruppen came well prepared with a team of software architects, DevOps managers, and operations, making it possible for us to hit the ground running and get down to the tech allmost immediately. The teams from Microsoft and Møllergruppen were: 

| Person           		| Role                         | 
| -----------------		| -----------------------------| 
| Alessandro Vozza 		| Microsoft, Kubernetes expert | 
| Pedro Dias       		| Microsoft, observer          |
| Jon Marius Håkedal 	| Lead Software Architect      | 
| Christian Chavez 		| DevOps                       | 
| Vebjørn Svare    		| IT Operations                | 
| Jørgen Nyen-Pedersen  | Architecture                 |
| Anders Nordby         | It Operations                |

## Hit the ground running
After a brief round of introduction, Alessandro did a short introduction to Kubernetes to bring everyone present up to speed. 
After the intro, we set up an agenda for work, and followed it through during our 2-day hack.

>**Resource group discussion** <br/>
>During the hackfest, we discussed how to manage cost-control over the different teams and their use of Kubernetes. 
>Møllergruppen initially thought of having one Kubernetes cluster per team, but quickly dismissed it as the whole idea
>behind Kubernetes is the ability to access named services. We ended up on having one Resource Group for dev/testing, 
>and one production group. Møllergruppen will then split the cost of their dev environment by the teams. 

## Day 1 summary
Filled out a partial ACS-E template, filled it out with local values
Have a running cluster with 1 master and 2 slaves. 

**Issues**<br />
A firewall prevented the creation of a VPN tunnel to the Kubernetes cluster from Møllergruppen, but was fixed prior to day 2 engagement.

We also tried to remove public access to the cluster, and reached a semi-working solution but left us without a proper way to connect to the cluster. 


## Day 2 summary
- Set up a CI/CD Pipeline 
- Set up role-based access to Kubernetes

## Technical details of the work delivered

*General overview of what we did during the hackfest. Detailed technical steps are documented below, write them such that anyone can pick up on the instructions and repeat on their own*

### Creating an ACS-E Template
Created a template to define the vNet, Master and Agents
*More text needed here*

#### Instructions
*Short list of instructions on how to do this here*

### ACS Engine Installation
The Azure Container Service Engine (acs-engine) generates ARM (Azure Resource Manager) templates for Docker enabled clusters on Microsoft Azure with your choice of DC/OS, Kubernetes, Swarm Mode, or Swarm orchestrators. The input to the tool is a cluster definition. The cluster definition is very similar to (in many cases the same as) the ARM template syntax used to deploy a Microsoft Azure Container Service cluster.
#### Instructions 

### Genereated the ARM Templates
The ACS Engine runs locally on your machine or on the cloud shell. 
Once installed, you run it to produce the ARM Templates that will 
set up the necessary infrastructure required by Kubernetes.

## Going forward


## Open questions
- SSH Management, do we use Puppet? Ansible?

### Enabling role-based access to Kubernetes

We wanted to set up role-based access to Kubernetes to manage who has access in tight integration with Møllergruppen's AD. 
To do this, we followed this guide **to the letter**, as recommended by Alessandro: <br />
